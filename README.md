# TabLock
# This project is a browser extension that will redirect users to a mitivational message when they open a new tab. 
# This prevents users from procrastination and drive productivity and build healthier working habits. 
# Instead of blocking the user's ability to add a new tab, we will prioritize creating a program where it will direct the new tab with a motivation message to maintain users' primary focus.

# Project Technology usage:
# HTML/CSS - UI development
# Javascript for logic and operation
